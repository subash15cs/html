                <h3><u>Fantastic Four</u></h3>
                <p>Fantastic Four (sometimes stylized as Fantastic 4) is a 2005 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics
                    superhero team of the same name, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It was directed by Tim Story, and released by
                    20th Century Fox. The film stars Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, Julian McMahon and Kerry
                    Washington. This was the second live-action Fantastic Four film to be filmed. A previous attempt, titled The
                    Fantastic Four, was a B-movie produced by Roger Corman that ultimately went unreleased. Fantastic Four was released
                    in the United States on July 8, 2005. Despite receiving generally mixed reviews from critics, it grossed over $333
                    million worldwide and was a box office success. A sequel, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, was released in
                    2007. A reboot was released in 2015.</p>

                <h6><u>Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer</u></h6>
                <p>Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (titled Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer on home media) is a 2007
                    American superhero film, and sequel to the 2005 film Fantastic Four. Both films are based on the Fantastic Four
                    comic book and were directed by Tim Story. The film stars Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, and Michael
                    Chiklis as the title characters, with Julian McMahon, Kerry Washington, Andre Braugher, Beau Garrett, Doug Jones and
                    Laurence Fishburne in supporting roles. The plot follows the Fantastic Four (and Doctor Doom) as they confront, and
                    later ally with, the Silver Surfer to save Earth from Galactus. The film was released on June 15, 2007 in North
                    America. Critical reception was generally mixed but also slightly better than the first film. The film grossed over
                    $301 million worldwide, but earned less than its predecessor which grossed $333.5 million worldwide. A third film was
                    planned but ultimately cancelled, which was attributed to factors such as the film's box office disappointment, the
                    conflict between the director and Jessica Alba, and the producers having trouble finding a new director for a planned
                    Silver Surfer spin-off. As such, the franchise even ended up in development hell. The series was rebooted in 2015
                    with the release of Fantastic Four to poor critical and commercial reception. Marvel Studios eventually claimed the
                    film rights of the characters, along with the X-Men and Deadpool, after the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by
                    Disney.</p>
